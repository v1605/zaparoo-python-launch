# zaparoo-python-launch
An example utility script to launch Zaparoo scripts via python

Requires installing the "websocket-client" library. After your python environment is setup, the main script takes two parameters. The first is the websocket url to the Zaparoo service (eg. ws://mister.local:7497) and the second is the [ZapSript](https://wiki.zaparoo.org/ZapScript#Generic_Launch_(launch)) to run.
